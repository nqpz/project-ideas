# Bike Wrong

You're living in a big city with plenty of opportunity for biking
around on your bicycle.

You love this, but it has always bothered you that many people seem to
care about rules and treating each other nicely in the traffic.  You are
not one of them.

In this game you must bike sufficiently badly in order to cause traffic
chaos in increasing amounts of difficulty.


## Downgrades

You can downgrade your bicycle in multiple ways to make it easier to
ride it badly:

  - Remove lights.  This will make it harder for people to spot you.
  - Put lights on backwards.  This will confuse other bicyclists.
  - Mount a loudspeaker on your bike.  This will make it hard for people
    to contact you.


## Levels

  - Level 1: Cause at least one cyclist to have to stop suddenly.
  - Level 2: Cause at least one cyclist to fall over.


## Gameplay

3D with physics.
