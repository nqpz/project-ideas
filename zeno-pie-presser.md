# Zeno's Pie Presser

Goal: Get as many pies as you can.

Approach: Use the mouse to press on a pie to make a pie.

Problem: In order to create a pie, you first need to have made half a
pie; and to make half a pie, you first need to have made a quarter of a
pie.  In fact, there is no way you could ever finish creating a pie,
seeing as that process consists of infinite steps.

Solution: Find a way to map infinity down onto a finite plane.


## Gameplay

Piece together bad physics to form arguments favoring your wish to
produce pies.  For example, to counter the bad physics problem of not
being able to complete an infinite number of steps in finite time, you
can use the bad physics solution of saying that if you can make one pie
in an infinite amount of steps, then you can also imagine doing that in
parallel and making an infinite amount of cookies in an infinite amount
of steps, both of which you can then divide by infinity, allowing you to
make one pie in one step.

These pies exist in a world without modern physics, which can be
exploited to increase the pie production.


## Graphics

Split between pie production and proofs for pie production.  For the
proofs:

  - Make it easily viewable what base arguments exist.
  - Make it easy to create and prove new theorems.
