# Deduction Deducted

## Premise

This is a story about a character who is very good at using deductive
steps to solve mysteries, but who's ended up in a world where cause and
effect have no meaning.


## Examples

"These flowers were bought one year ago, you say?" He nodded. "But they
are still fresh!" She pointed at them. "So they must have been replaced,
which means someone *did* enter this room."

She saw him looking at her, not understanding this reasoning, or perhaps
the concept of reasoning itself, she wasn't sure.  Finally he spoke. "No
one has entered this room, because the seagull came by yesterday."

Now she was the one who lacked an understanding.  After a pause he
repeated himself, trying to explain it again: "The seagull came by
yesterday, so we know for sure that no one could have entered this
room.  Of course!"  The last bit he almost yelled.

"The seagulls?" she asked tentatively, "they freshen up flowers?" She
wanted to remain friendly with someone as close to the case as him, but
she was also desperately unsure of how to communicate with him.

Finally, he responded.  He had the look of a poorly-educated teacher
despising having to answer questions.  He waited until she looked at
him, then spoke in a matter-of-factly voice:

"The factory is closed in one thousand years, so the seagull came by
yesterday, which means someone entered this room, and, as such, you
exist."
