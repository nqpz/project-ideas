# Get scanned by the supermarket barcode scanner

In this game you'll be controlling the items that someone is buying in a
supermarket.  You come alive at the point where you're thrown onto the
checkout counter and slowly rolling towards the barcode scanner.  This
is fine.  You want to be bought.


## Rogue barcode scanner

The problem is that the barcode scanner is not sane.  It will do
everything in its power to not scan you, which will cause the
supermarket to lose profits.  No one knows why this supermarket chain
exclusively buys rogue scanners, you just have to do your best to get
scanned.

In fact, why not get scanned more than once?  It's more profit.  But the
barcode scanner will get progressively better at avoiding you.


## Escalation

If you try to get too close too many times, the barcode scanner will try
to escape from the checkout stand and into the larger general
supermarket area.  This is a gamble on its side, since it might
accidentally scan something with so many items around it, but it will do
this if you're aggressive enough.  You can try to follow it.


## Style of game

Simple 3D physics.
