# Stop puzzling me around

**Pitch:** You just about woke up and immediately you went for the
cupboard containing the cereal product.  It's locked by a much larger
lock than seems necessary.  Turning around, beginning to notice your
surroundings in your half-asleep state of mind, a smiling face is
harassing you: Your sister.

Her smile turns into a frown as she tells you sternly: "No breakfast
unless you solve the lock puzzle."

You give up, defeated.  You have been falling behind in puzzling class in
school, that was true, but now your own family is also forcing you to
learn this useless part of the world we exist in?  No breakfast for
you today, then.  What a cruel, puzzle-filled world.

It is indeed the entire world that is a puzzling place, literally.
Everyone loves puzzles.  Making puzzles is cool.  Solving puzzles is
sexy.  The tougher the puzzles you make and solve, the more social
capital you accrue.

You think they were all crazy.  Everything would be *simpler* if people
did things *directly* instead of hiding things behind puzzles.  It is an
inefficiency.  It is also something you are really bad at.

...

**Solution:** You discover a *puzzle bot* which can solve any puzzle for
you.  You use this to navigate in the world to avoid having to think
about puzzles yourself, while still having almost all your interactions
be about puzzles.

*Dislike brainteasers?  Get a puzzle bot!*


## Style

Likely text-based.

The puzzles should be real, but also only really solvable by a computer.


## Possible developments

- The robot loses its fun personality as it gets better at solving
  puzzles, allocating more of its energy into that aspect.

- Since it gets trivial to solve puzzles, you end up making only
  high-level choices.  At some point the robot can also interpret these
  high-level choices as puzzles and will begin solving them for you,
  leaving you to make decisions on a whole other level.

- The puzzle bot ends up running the world (it's all puzzles), and
  you'll end up having to change parameters in order to save your
  friends.  You find a secondary puzzle bot to correct the data that the
  main puzzle bot is depending on for its decisions.
