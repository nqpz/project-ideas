# Stand in line

You're standing in a queue, waiting to buy something.

You can step out of the line, but then you lose the game.

Sometimes the line will move forward, but it is still very long, so it
is not necessarily something that you will notice when it happens.


## Gameplay

Do not move out of the queue.

When the queue moves forwards, move along with it.

Sometimes there will be distractions, such as shorter lines forming
close to you or people having fun, but you should not let yourself be
tempted by this (if you do, you lose).


## Implementation

Simple top-down pixel graphics?
