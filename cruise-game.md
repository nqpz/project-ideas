# Unnamed cruise game

You're going cruising!


## Structure

Several phases:

  - Simulation-based: Construct/rearrange the ship to your liking in
    order to manipulate the guests how you like.
  - Narrative-based: In order to change the context for the construction
    once in a while.  Optional?

The game cannot be won in a classic sense, but it should be possible for
the player to set their own (implicit) goals and build the simulation
for that.


## Simulation

Several parts:

  - The decks, the rooms in the decks, and the connections between rooms
    and decks.
  - The people, each person with their own skills and desires.
  - The events, which might enable people's desires.

Notes:

  - Guests can become workers, and the opposite way around.  Being a
    guest or not is not a binary attribute, but a probability (possibly
    based on sub-probabilities).  Under certain stresses, this
    probability may change.
  - Start with a random layout, and then ask the player to rearrange
    that one?  The initial layout should be somewhat sustainable to
    allow for the player to learn how the ship works.  But maybe it
    would also be fun to be thrown into a very dysfunctional ship.
