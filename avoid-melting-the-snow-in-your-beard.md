# Avoid melting the snow in your beard

You just arrived at work.  You drove to the office on your bicycle and
were surprised to find it snowing all the way.  Looking down at your
beard now, you see it's all white.  Very cool!  This you gotta show your
colleagues.  "Look, my beard is all white!" you'll tell them.

However, the snow might melt.  It is actually not that could outside,
and inside it is even warmer.  Also, your office is pretty deep inside
the building.

It is imperative that you impress your colleagues with the snow in your
beard before it melts.  There is nothing impressive about having a wet
beard!


## Gameplay

Basic time management.  For example, you can choose to lower the
temperature of the building, but this action will take time to complete
depending on how good you are at handling climate systems.


## Endgame

Your colleagues should have different reactions based on how much snow
you maintained in your beard.
